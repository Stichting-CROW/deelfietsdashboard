## Introduction

The CROW-Fietsberaad Dashboard Deelmobiliteit uses MDS to collect information on shared mobility to present to regulatory agencies, usually municipalities. This data is provided by operators.

CROW Dashboard Deelmobiliteit requires MDS, a data standard designed for regulatory use. With this we are following the selected CDS-M data standard.

In the past GBFS and TOMP were supported as well for compatibility reasons. These data formats will be phased out, as these are designed for traveler information and not regulatory purposes.
